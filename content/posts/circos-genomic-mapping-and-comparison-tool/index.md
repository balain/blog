Although it's not something I'd ever use, the fact that someone spent time building a tool that generates some of the most interesting and dense graphics I've ever seen amazes me.

Circos compares genome maps and displays their similarities and differences in numerous visual formats -- [http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos/?](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos/?)

It was the software used in the graphic showing Presidential candidates' references to other candidates, as mentioned in [an earlier post](https://blog.balinsbooks.com/2009/01/01/beautiful-graphic-on-politicians-naming-names/ "in an earlier post").

Thanks to [FlowingData](http://flowingdata.com/ "FlowingData") for the link.
