Found a great decision graph on how to pick the right chart type for your next presentation(s): [http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/blog/2006/09/choosing\_a\_good.html](http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/blog/2006/09/choosing_a_good.html)

Writen by Andrew Abela, it displays visually how to choose (what he thinks is) the best type of graph for a particular need. Clear, concise, and useful, it's a good way to get started. The comments have some other ideas and pages with similar info.
