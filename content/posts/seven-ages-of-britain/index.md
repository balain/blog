[BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/) presents a new series called "[Seven Ages Of Britain](http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/01_january/20/britain2.shtml)" starting on 1/31/2010. Each of the seven episodes represents an era in British history, narrated by David Dimbleby. I'm particularly interested in the first age:

> Programme 1: **Age Of Conquest (AD 43-1066)** - For a thousand years, from Emperor Claudius to William the Conqueror, the British Isles were defined by invasion, each successive wave bringing something new to the mix. The Romans brought figurative art, the Anglo-Saxons epic poetry, the Normans monumental architecture. David Dimbleby travels throughout Britain and beyond – to France, Italy and Turkey – in search of the greatest creations of the age.
> 
> Programme includes: bronze bust of Hadrian (British Museum); fragment of triumphal arch commemorating Claudius' conquest of Britain (Palazzo dei Conservatori, Rome); Roman coin of Britannia (Pantheon, Rome); frieze of Britannia under the heel of Emperor Claudius (Aphrodisias, Turkey); Roman gold brooch (Dolaucothi Gold Mine, Wales); Oceanus Dish (British Museum); Roman mosaic work (Bignor Roman Villa); Beowulf; Sutton Hoo treasure (Sutton Hoo and British Museum); Celtic Cross (Iona); Jarrow Monastery; Codex Amiatinus (Laurentian Library, Florence); Alfred Jewel (Ashmolean Museum); Alfred's translation of Pastoral Care (Bodleian Library); Caen Castle and the Abbaye-aux-Hommes (Normandy); Bayeux Tapestry (Normandy); the Tower of London.
