Regardless of what you think about The Donald, if you enjoy computers, you'll love [TrumpScript](https://github.com/samshadwell/TrumpScript) -- "Making Python great again!" Created by Sam Shadwell, a student Rice University, according to [his GitHub profile page](https://github.com/samshadwell).

A few features listed on [the page](https://github.com/samshadwell/TrumpScript):

- All programs must end with `America is great`.
- Our language will automatically correct Forbes' $4.5B to $10B.
- In its raw form, TrumpScript is not compatible with Windows, because Trump isn't the type of guy to believe in PC.
- The language is completely case insensitive.

The author has posted 103 commits to this repository between Jan 16 and Jan 22. Wow. Sounds like he's serious about getting Python back to where it once was!

Enjoy!
