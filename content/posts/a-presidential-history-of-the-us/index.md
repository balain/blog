[Rachel Mercer](http://portfolio.rachelmercer.org/)'s graphic "[Presidential Costs](http://portfolio.rachelmercer.org/projects/2666196)" shows, in a circular timeline, the history of the US through a history of the presidents, from Washington through Obama. Four layers of rings plus a ring of bubbles visualizes the time periods, key legislative acts, foreign conflicts and wars, and national debt. Very nice graphic.
