Bibleworks 8 has been announced. Details are available at the Bibleworks website ([http://www.bibleworks.com/](http://www.bibleworks.com/ "http://www.bibleworks.com/")). Looks like a few more databases (mostly non-English and non-original language), some cross-reference functionality, and the inclusion of previously for-fee Greek and Hebrew grammars. Need to look more closely to see if it's worth the $150 upgrade from version 7.
