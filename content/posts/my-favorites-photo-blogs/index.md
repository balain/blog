I was asked recently from a friend which Photography websites (and blogs) I found helpful, being the pretty-new-to-photography amateur. It's difficult to separate some photography sites from design sites, so you may see a mix here. Anyway, enough with the preamble... Here are the home sites -- you'll find the link to their RSS feeds there:

1. Smashing Magazine \[[http://www.smashingmagazine.com/](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/)\] One of the first blogs I read; always interesting and different (at least to me :)
2. Digital Photography School \[[http://www.digital-photography-school.com/](http://www.digital-photography-school.com/)\] Loads of helpful tutorials, guides, reviews, etc. First stop...
3. Stamen Design \[[http://content.stamen.com/](http://content.stamen.com/)\] Stunning and original
4. Abduzeedo \[[http://Abduzeedo.com](http://Abduzeedo.com)\] Retro and neon, but informative
5. BittBox \[[http://www.bittbox.com/](http://www.bittbox.com/)\] Lots of free stuff, guides, and slick samples
6. Photojojo \[[http://photojojo.com/](http://photojojo.com/)\] Shiny, pretty things and gadgets
7. Creative Tech Tips \[[http://creativetechs.com/tipsblog/](http://creativetechs.com/tipsblog/)\] Mostly Photoshop and Illustrator stuff, but some photography tips
8. Photography BB \[[http://www.photographybb.com/](http://www.photographybb.com/)\] Very professional and well organized around a print publication
9. WedPix \[[http://www.wedpix.com/](http://www.wedpix.com/)\] Wedding Photojournalist Association website; mostly commercial, but some good tips and techniques
10. Just Creative Design \[[http://justcreativedesign.com/](http://justcreativedesign.com/)\] Simple yet helpful

I hope these are interesting and useful for you.

P.S. Photojojo just posted a list of "10 Online Photography Magazines We Love" \[[http://photojojo.com/content/tips/10-online-photography-magazines/](http://photojojo.com/content/tips/10-online-photography-magazines/)\]. Might be worth a gander...
