[![Lincoln's Constitution](images/783819.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/783819.Lincoln_s_Constitution)[Lincoln's Constitution](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/783819.Lincoln_s_Constitution) by [Daniel A. Farber](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/101536.Daniel_A_Farber)

My rating: [5 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/114726000)

Excellent and thoroughly researched review of the issues surrounding Lincoln's presidency, specifically how the Constitutionality of his decisions could be viewed during and since his time in office. Farber clearly understands his topic, providing both ample detail and excellent additional references to both primary and secondary sources. Finally, he makes this potentially very dry subject palatable through clear and concise prose.
