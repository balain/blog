The team (including Amanda Cox) at NYTimes.com has done it again: a clear and engaging info graphic showing [\[Michael\] Jackson’s Billboard Rankings Over Time](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/06/25/arts/0625-jackson-graphic.html). Whatever you think of his music, the data are pretty engaging.
