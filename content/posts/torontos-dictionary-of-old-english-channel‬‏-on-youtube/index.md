Recently, the University of Toronto's _Dictionary of Old English_ (DOE) project recently posted a new video advertising the need for a comprehensive dictionary of the earliest English language: [YouTube - ‪DictionaryOldEnglish's Channel‬‏](http://www.youtube.com/user/DictionaryOldEnglish). Slick and concise, the video does a good job appealing to a more visual audience. Let's hope that some of them pick up Old English! :D

BTW, I still have my original microfiche fascicles of the first few letters. Good stuff!
