If you're looking for a superb piece of Bible software, look at BibleWorks ([http://www.bibleworks.com/](http://www.bibleworks.com/ "http://www.bibleworks.com/")). Pricey, sure, but you'll never need another package. Tons of versions, aids, commentaries, etc. BAGD is available, as are Hebrew and Greek lexicons, instructional materials, maps, even sentence diagrams (in Greek!). Very cool! It's all I use.
