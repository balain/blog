[Staffordshire Hoard is coming to America - Medievalists.net](http://www.medievalists.net/2011/08/12/staffordshire-hoard-is-coming-to-america/).

Wonderful news! Can't wait to see the exhibition. Given the current collaborators, I'm sure it will be top notch. It has been a long time since I've seen a world-class medieval exhibition, the last one being "The Making of England" at the British Museum/Library some twenty years ago.

For more information about the hoard, see [the website](http://www.staffordshirehoard.org.uk/). In late 2009, the British Museum Press published [a small (48pp) volume on the hoard](http://www.amazon.com/Staffordshire-Hoard-Roger-Bland/dp/0714123285) (ISBN: 978-0714123288), with a sampling of photographs.
