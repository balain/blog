Livescribe just delivered version 0.8 of their Pulse SmartPen SDK ([http://www.livescribe.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/LDApp.woa/wa/DeveloperOverviewPage](http://www.livescribe.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/LDApp.woa/wa/DeveloperOverviewPage)). Looks very slick...

They've added a new environment: "Eclipse with Livescribe Plugins" that gives Eclipse two new views: "Pen Debug" and "Pen Info." Haven't had time to really jump in, yet, but hope it's a solid release toward their more complete dev environment.

Oh, yeah, and they froze their API. Phew. That'll help...

BTW, [here's Robert Hanson's take](http://groups.google.com/group/penlets/browse_thread/thread/9b04459a61ffc045/8ac841bc9d3748ee?show_docid=8ac841bc9d3748ee "here's Robert Hanson's take")
