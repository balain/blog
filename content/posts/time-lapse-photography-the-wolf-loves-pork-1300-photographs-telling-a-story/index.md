In 3 minutes and 55 seconds, Takeuchi Taijin tells a funny tale of a wolf and a pig. The photographs weave around the apartment, room by room, up and down walls, over the floor, using the kitchen as a pool, the wall as an elevator, and making amazing use of 3D space to engage the viewer. What a fun show. Enjoy!
