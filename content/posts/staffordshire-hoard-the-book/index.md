![The Staffordshire Hoard Book (from the British Museum Shop website)](images/cmc23288_productsize.jpg "The Staffordshire Hoard Book (from the British Museum Shop website)")

I just received my copy of [the British Museum book](http://www.britishmuseumshoponline.org/invt/cmc23288) on [the Staffordshire Hoard](http://www.staffordshirehoard.org.uk/). Although it's a bit shorter than I'd like (but matches the page count listed on the BM site), it has some lovely pictures, a concise history, and an overall adequate summary of the find itself. Glad to support the work going on there.

Some day, I'd like to see the artifacts in person, but until I get across the pond, I'll have to settle for this book. A tidy little picturebook, to be sure...
