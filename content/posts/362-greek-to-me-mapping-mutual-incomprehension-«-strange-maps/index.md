Ever wonder what other language speakers say when they don't understand something? Is it Greek to everyone? What is it to Greek-speakers? Now you can know, thanks to [362 - Greek To Me: Mapping Mutual Incomprehension « Strange Maps](http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2009/02/26/362-greek-to-me-mapping-mutual-incomprehension/). Very interesting. Guess the Japanese don't have a comparative expression, since their bubble doesn't link out... Anyone know?
