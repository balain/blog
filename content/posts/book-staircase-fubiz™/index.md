![Staircase Bookshelves (from fubiz.net)](images/schody4.jpg "Staircase Bookshelves (from fubiz.net)")

I love books and creative design. Unfortunately for some, space is very tight and finding room for their books can be a challenge. Rather than pitching out the books, [Levitate (London)](http://www.levitate.uk.com/), cleverly folded their architectural skills and creativity together to make a [Book Staircase](http://www.fubiz.net/2009/11/04/book-staircase/). The sides are almost flush with the forward shelf edges. The steps alternate. Overall, a very nice job. I wonder if there are any lights (cable lights, maybe?) underneath the shelving.

The apartment, which apparently belongs to [Victoria and Sebastian](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/ny/house-tours/at-europe-london-house-tour-veronika-sebastians-rooftop-victorian-042388) and has been featured [numerous other places](http://www.google.com/search?q=book+staircase), including [ApartmentTherapy](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/ny/at-europe/at-europe-london-closeup-the-amazing-staircase-042543) (where other photos of the apartment are available) and [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2008/02/19/library-built-into-a.html).
