I'm bummed -- I won't be able to make the [WorldWidePhotoWalk](http://worldwidephotowalk.com/) this weekend in Annapolis --see [27,000 photographers to "walk" this weekend - Technology Live - USATODAY.com](http://blogs.usatoday.com/technologylive/2009/07/27000-photographers-to-walk-this-weekend.html) for more info. Looks like a blast! I've passed this on to a friend, hoping he'll get some good pictures of downtown and the Academy. Forecast looks pretty good (if you like heat ;) too.
