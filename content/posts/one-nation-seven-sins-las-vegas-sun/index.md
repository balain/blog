For a fascinating portrait of how the 7 deadly sins have materialized in the US, take a look at [One nation, seven sins - Las Vegas Sun](http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/mar/26/one-nation-seven-sins/). It maps, in impressive detail, how those infamous markers of decadence have struck our country, putting an objective measurement to those habitually non-quantitative metrics. An effective piece of data visualization, because it tells a dire tale.

The most interesting aspect of this article, however, is that it was published by a secular newspaper, completely unrelated to any religion or denomination. Fascinating.
