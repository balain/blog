# [The Wailin' Jennys](http://www.thewailinjennys.com/)

This is one **beautiful** song...

![](images/firecracker.jpg "Firecracker album cover")_Glory Bound_ (Ruth Moody) When I hear that trumpet sound I will lay my burdens down I will lay them deep into the ground Then I'll know that I am glory bound I'll be travelin' far from home But I won't be looking for to roam I'll be crossing o'er the great divide In a better home soon I will reside Hallelujah When I'm in my resting place I'll look on my mother's face Never more will I have to know All the loneliness that plagues me so So I'm waiting for that train to come And I know where she's coming from Listen can you hear her on the track When I board I won't be looking back Hallelujah
