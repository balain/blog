The Flying Lizards](http://www.lizardms.com) paired with [TRG](http://www.theracersgroup.com/) ([see their announcement](http://www.lizardms.com/news/releases/2009/dec-24.html)) in [the 2010 Rolex 24 at Daytona](http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Tickets-Events/Events/2010/Rolex-24/Rolex-24-At-Daytona.aspx). Their Porsche 911 GT3 came in 2nd at this year's Rolex 24 hour race at Daytona. (See [the Flying Lizards' press release](http://www.lizardms.com/news/releases/2010/jan-31.html) and [the TRG press release](http://www.theracersgroup.com/news/show.php?id=392).)

Glad to see the podium finish for the Lizards! I look forward to seeing them in their next race (Sebring on 3/20) and the rest of [the 2010 schedule](http://www.lizardms.com/schedule/2010.htm). Go Lizards!
