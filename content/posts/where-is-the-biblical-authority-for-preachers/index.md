A few days ago, a friend asked me where the Bible authorized paid preachers. He is struggling with some history at his home church where they split because the preacher wouldn't submit to the elders leadership (which is a separate problem). That whole event started him asking why we have preachers. Doesn't having a preacher take (whether really or just implicitly) the responsibility we have of evangelizing? How many people say (again, whether consciously or unconsciously): "Why do I need to go here or there teaching? Isn't that the job of the Preacher? Won't he do that?"

There are a few places I thought of off the bat: preachers are "worth their pay" (Romans 4:4: "Romans 4:4   Now to the one who (a)works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. " (NAU)), but my greatest concern is where this will lead... "Why do we need a church at all?" The questioner deserves a full response with clear logic. I'll put that together soon...
