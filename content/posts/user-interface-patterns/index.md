Since first reading the Gang-of-four's book, I have thought patterns were a great idea. Now that I'm getting into design and data visualization more, I'm intrigued by the possibility of merging interface design with software patterns. Makes sense, don't you think?

So, when I found [UI-patterns.com](http://ui-patterns.com/), I thought "yes! here's the merging of the two disciplines/approaches. Great. Now if I can just merge these patterns with Tufte-based principles and OVID-based development, I should be able to come up with a potent app in any environment.
