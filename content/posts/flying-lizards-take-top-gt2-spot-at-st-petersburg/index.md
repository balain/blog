Congratulations to [the Flying Lizard team](http://www.lizardms.com/)! The #45 Porsche 911 GT2, driven by Patrick Long and JÃ¶rg Bergmeister, take the top spot at today's ALMS race at St. Petersburg. The Flying Lizard team was able to keep the car in the running, while many other participants fell out due to various technical difficulties.

P.S. Good to see BMW do so well, especially after the challenges they experienced at Sebring a few weeks ago. Great show!
