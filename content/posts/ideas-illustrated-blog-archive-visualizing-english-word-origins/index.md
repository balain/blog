[Ideas Illustrated » Blog Archive » Visualizing English Word Origins](http://ideasillustrated.com/blog/2012/04/01/visualizing-english-word-origins/).

Looking at the origin of words and comparing fiction (British and American), medical writing, legal writing, and sports writing.

Good thing I have some history with Old English, or I might not understand anything... hahah... and no wonder I don't understand Medical lit -- it's the least OE-based. A little surprised that Medical lit has more Old French than Legal -- would have expected more OF, but maybe the Latin makes up the difference.

Interesting. And geeky, too.
