Google's Chief Economist, Hal Varian, says "the sexy job in the next ten years will be statisticians." Sounds great.\[Source The McKinsey Quarterly ([http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Hal\_Varian\_on\_how\_the\_Web\_challenges\_managers\_2286](http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Hal_Varian_on_how_the_Web_challenges_managers_2286)), via the Flowingdata blog ([http://flowingdata.com/2009/02/25/googles-chief-economist-hal-varian-on-statistics-and-data/](http://flowingdata.com/2009/02/25/googles-chief-economist-hal-varian-on-statistics-and-data/)).\]

What will data visualization look like in 10 years? Will the goals change? Will there be a fundamental shift in what data mean for businesses, or just how it's reported? Time will tell, but in any event...
