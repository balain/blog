[![](images/DP2C28-map.jpg "High School graduation percentage by county")](http://www.statjump.com/lists/school-graduates-dp2c28bc.html)A few days ago, the great [Revolutions blog](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/) posted ("[Visualizing the census](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2010/07/visualizing-the-census.html)") about a new utility called [StatJump](http://www.statjump.com/index.html) where you can visualize data from the 2010 US Census using, of course, R. Pretty impressive. The image here shows the percentage of students graduating High School, by county. There are tons of canned visualizations -- just click one of the menu items (e.g. "Social Demographic Data") on the home page. You can also run your own searches, though it only seems to return the data in a table -- i.e. I haven't figured out how to generate these maps from my own search. Very powerful tool, considering all those data being searched.
