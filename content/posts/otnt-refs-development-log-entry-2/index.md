[![](images/otnt-rev4-150x150.png "otnt-rev4")](https://blog.balinsbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/otnt-rev4.png)Added some random links to test where I should set the "through" point -- at 2r/3, 1r/3, 7r/8, or some other value (notice the grey circles in the graphic at those settings). Suggestions?
