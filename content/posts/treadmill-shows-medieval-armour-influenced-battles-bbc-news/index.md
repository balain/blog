[![Still from BBC video](https://blog.balinsbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/54144908_armouries_004.jpg)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14204717)

So, now that we have treadmills, scientists realize that bulky armor would have influenced medieval warfare? Really? Genius!

[BBC News - Treadmill shows medieval armour influenced battles](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14204717).

My favorite quotation from the article has to be: "Researchers always suspected the armour would have been tough to wear." Brilliant!
