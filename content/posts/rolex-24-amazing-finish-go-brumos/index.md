Can't believe the finish at the [Rolex 24](http://www.grand-am.com/rolex/schedule/results.cfm?eid=863)! Amazing. After 24 hours of racing, less than 30 seconds separated the top 4 LMP cars. WOW. What a great race. Glad to see Brumos on the podium... x2! I wish the TV would show more of the GT-class, though. (Congrats to [TRG](http://www.theracersgroup.com/) for [pulling off the victory there](http://www.theracersgroup.com/news/show.php?id=392)!)

Now, to get ready for [12 Hours of Sebring](http://www.sebringraceway.com/12hour.lasso). Can't wait...

Go [Brumos](http://www.brumosracing.com/index.php/site/)!!!
