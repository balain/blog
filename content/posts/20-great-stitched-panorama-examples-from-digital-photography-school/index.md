From massive Air Force transport planes to the standard (but breathtaking!) landscapes (mountains, the Grand Canyon, etc) to simple room shots (even a bathroom shot!), the breadth of possibilities is more than I originally thought.

In case you're interested, my simple first panorama was taken [at the Naval Academy bridge](http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/XzrmNL5IujjWZns3UJuOxQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCIXw7ZGit9bXFw&feat=directlink). Hope you enjoy!
