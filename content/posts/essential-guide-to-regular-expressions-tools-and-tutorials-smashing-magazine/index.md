I'm always struggling with the various regular expressions, even after using them for over a decade. Maybe it's because of all the variations (perl vs. your favorite windows-based text editor's flavor of regexps vs. bash vs. you-name-it). Maybe it's because I'm just plain getting old. (nah!)

Although better known for photography tips, Smashing Magazine has a nice collection of tutorials on RegExps -- [Essential Guide To Regular Expressions: Tools and Tutorials](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/01/essential-guide-to-regular-expressions-tools-tutorials-and-resources/). Check it out.
