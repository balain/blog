Found a JavaScript-driven Flash-based globe application for simple GIS apps, called [Poly9 Globe: the lightest, most compatible 3D globe on the web](http://globe.poly9.com/). They have [full API documentation](http://freeearth.poly9.com/api/documentation.php), too. Pretty slick, if your requirements are simple.
