I installed and configured my new blog. To keep the start of the blog I had at wordpress.com, I moved those posts and comments here, updated the theme, downloaded and configured a few widgets, and am pretty happy with the current state.

Someday, I'll crack open some of these widgets, read a few pages, and build my own widget. It would be very cool to link the blog with [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com "Evernote"), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com "Twitter"), and, maybe, [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/ "Flickr"). [Tarpipe](http://dev.tarpipe.com/ "Tarpipe") looks interesting and I've already tested its ability to post new tweets via email. Very slick. No reason I couldn't post something here...

Tried the [MyTwitter](http://anwanore.com/2007/10/20/twitterplugin "MyTwitter") widget but couldn't get it to work. I guess it's due to the Wordpress software, but don't know for sure. Will try more later.
