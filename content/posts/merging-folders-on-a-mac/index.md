Tried to find a nice GUI way to merge folders on my Mac. After searching, I discovered that I wasn't missing something - [the Finder doesn't support merging folder contents](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=271139). I didn't want to buy one of the [many](http://www.qdea.com/synchronize_x_plus_intro.html) [available](http://www.econtechnologies.com/pages/cs/chrono_overview.html) Finder extensions (since I'm naturally cheap). And I didn't want to go through setting up [Unison](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/) (which I have used for more heavy-lifting, including remote backups/copies -- it does work well) for a potentially one-off solution. So I found a few command-line options described (with examples) at [456bereastreet.com](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201102/merging_directories_folders_on_mac_os_x/).

I also found a US$2 [GUI for ditto by iLike](http://ilike.co.nz/SoftwareDev/dittoGUI.html), which I bought. (If I weren't really lazy, I would code it up in Mac to try out what I've learned reading through [MacRuby in Action](http://www.manning.com/lim/) by [Manning](http://www.manning.com/), but...)
