As someone who's new to R and curious about what it can do, one of the first questions I ask is how does it compare to Java, C#, Perl, etc. (Insert language-of-choice here.) Fortunately,John Cook has answered that question with his blog post: [The R programming language for programmers coming from other programming languages](http://www.johndcook.com/R_language_for_programmers.html). Take a few minutes to check it out and see for yourself why R is the up-and-comer.
