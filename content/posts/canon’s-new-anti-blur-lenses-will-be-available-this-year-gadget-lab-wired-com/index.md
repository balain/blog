One of the problems I've seen and experienced taking photographs is unintended blur. Taking [a picture of a moving car](http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/UhWhwmVzGbdkGauyPI9pEg?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjzlq7C5bm4Ug&feat=directlink) or [a picture of a waterfall](http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/SvxJzzdOgoJ3wFJA5bq-IQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCJWZmb7IybHc9AE&feat=directlink), for example, you'll probably want to have some blur to show motion (otherwise, it doesn't look like the car is moving at all -- though [reading the labels of a tire on a car going 140 mph](http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/sLYkts75W297LnxJjcqvhw?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjzlq7C5bm4Ug&feat=directlink) is pretty nifty :). But usually blur _isn't_ a good thing. So, Canon will be [releasing new anti-blur lenses later this year (according to Wired)](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/07/canons-new-anti-blur-lenses-will-be-available-this-year/). Pretty neat, if it works. For details, [check out Wired's article](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/07/canons-new-anti-blur-lenses-will-be-available-this-year/). (Thanks to [the Click](http://theclick.us/2009/07/canon%E2%80%99s-new-anti-blur-lenses-will-be-available-this-year/) for the link.)
