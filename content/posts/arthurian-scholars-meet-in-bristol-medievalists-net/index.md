As announced on Medievalists.net, the 23rd Triennial Congress of the International Arthurian Society is meeting next week at the University of Bristol: [Arthurian scholars meet in Bristol - Medievalists.net](http://www.medievalists.net/2011/07/22/arthurian-scholars-meet-in-bristol/). I'm sure the public lecture will spend a lot of time reviewing portrayals of Arthur in the movies and current culture. Made me think of [the post at screened.com about the various portrayals of Merlin in the movies](http://www.screened.com/news/merlin-through-the-years/2588/).

Sounds like a fun time!
