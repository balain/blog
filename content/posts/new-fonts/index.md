![](images/2dca2f0b5a20affff2f01a9b241f06.gif "Sample from myfonts.com")I've updated the fonts on this site. TypeKit was fine, but I found several free fonts on [www.myfonts.com](http://www.myfonts.com/)Â that I really liked, all with unlimited web usage: Calluna (both [Regular](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/calluna/regular/) and [Sans Regular](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/calluna-sans/regular/)) and Fertigo Pro ([Regular](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/fertigo-pro/regular/)).
