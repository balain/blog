One thing I've always enjoyed is learning something new, especially a new language. First it started with human languages, but over the past few years (well, more than a few!) I've enjoyed learning new programming languages. From Lua to REXX to Icon to Processing (which, technically, isn't a language but more like an environment) and many others, I've loved tinkering with new languages. Now, I found a resource online that lets me compare the various languages. It's called (appropriately enough) [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Main_Page). Look for a solution to a problem by language or by problem. Fun stuff! Gotta go... Lots to learn...
