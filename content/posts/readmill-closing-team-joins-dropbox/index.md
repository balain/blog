According to [the Readmill.com closing announcement](https://readmill.com/epilogue):

> Our team will be joining Dropbox, where our expertise in reading, collaboration and syncing across devices finds a fitting home. Millions of people use Dropbox to store and share their digital lives, and we believe it’s a strong foundation on which to build the future of reading. We’re delighted to work alongside this talented team and imagine new ways to read together.

Interesting times ahead for Dropbox. I'm curious to see how they incorporate the lessons learned by Readmill in their platform.
