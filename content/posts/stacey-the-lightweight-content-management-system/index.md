Browsing around the web the other day, I found a clean, lightweight template system called **Stacey** \[[http://www.staceyapp.com](http://www.staceyapp.com/)\]. The layout and look is very straightforward and uncluttered. Using a subset of HTML tags, the most interesting feature is that it does not rely on any database -- it is completely text-based. It's also opensourced at github \[[http://github.com/kolber/stacey](http://github.com/kolber/stacey)\]

I wonder if anyone has found this useful or flexible enough to recommend this system over the other template systems out there.
