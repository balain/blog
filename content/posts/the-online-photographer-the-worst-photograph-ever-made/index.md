From 12/12/08, Mike Johnston, in his blog [The Online Photographer](http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/), calls this Annie Leibovitz photograph "[the worst photograph ever made](http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2008/12/the-worst-photo.html)":

According to Mr. Johnston, "\[the effort put into this photograph\] was all done intentionally, front to back, top to bottom, money-no-object, by an army of the most talented professionals, from art director to stylists to make-up artists to baby-wranglers to lighting assistants to photographer to digital retoucher, all working assiduously in concert in pursuit of the utterly pointless." Ouch!
