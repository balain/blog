Woohoo! Filming has begun on the new 10-part tv miniseries based on Malory's Morte dArthur:Â ['Camelot' Rolls into Ireland's Ardmore Studios | The Irish Film & Television Network](http://www.iftn.ie/news/?act1=record&only=1&aid=73&rid=4283163&tpl=archnews&force=1). King and Queen have been cast, along with several other major players. It has the potential to be very cheesy, but hopefully will avoid the most obvious glitzy traps of recent movies and shows. Keep your fingers crossed!
