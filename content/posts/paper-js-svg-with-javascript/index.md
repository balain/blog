"[Paper.js](http://paperjs.org) is an open source vector graphics scripting framework that runs on top of the HTML5 Canvas. It offers a clean Scene Graph / Document Object Model and a lot of powerful functionality to create and work with vector graphics and bezier curves, all neatly wrapped up in a well designed, consistent and clean programming interface."

I think this is the perfect platform for building my interactive OT/NT reference map app. I've bounced between Java ([Batik](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/)), [Processing](http://processing.org/), static images, and even Flash (which I don't know, so would have to learn), but none of them really gave me the simplicity and flexibility that Paper.js has.

More info to come... Stay tuned...
