[Dr. Stuart Lee](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~stuart/Site/About_Me.html) at the Oxford Computing Services department, has begun a new website, [Woruldhord](http://poppy.nsms.ox.ac.uk/woruldhord) (Old English for _World-hoard_),

> to collect together into an online hoard, digital objects related to the teaching, study, or research of Old English and the Anglo-Saxon period of history.

What a wonderful way to collect and revel in Old English material, even (especially?) if it's not part of your daily life any more.

Looks like Dr. Lee created other websites, one [a digital archive for World War I poetry](http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit) and another, [Dragons in the Sky](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~stuart/dits/), for "English-Speaking Communities at the Close of the Millennia" (although it hasn't been updated recently -- the July 2006 article by Dr Catherine Clarke, "Compensation Culture," is still marked "New").
