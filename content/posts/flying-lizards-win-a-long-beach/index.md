Another first place finish for [the Flying Lizards](http://www.lizardms.com/index.htm) #45 911 GT3 RSR! Great show. The #44 did an amazing job pulling up from the pack finishing 5th.

Congratulations! Keep up the **great** work! The cars, drivers, and teams are all doing a fantasitc job. With the addition of Corvette and Jaguar to the GT2 category, plus a few more 911-based teams in 2010, the competition will get even more fierce. Should be even more exciting to watch.
