Just found the transcript (with picture!) of George Washington's 1st State of the Union address as published on 21 JAN 1790 -- [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/George\_Washington%27s\_First\_State\_of\_the\_Union\_Address](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/George_Washington%27s_First_State_of_the_Union_Address). Fascinating!
