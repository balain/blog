Is auto-focus a real problem? I'm not sure, but I have an XSi which seems to work pretty well. A friend has a D90 and some of the shots taken with his camera (on auto-focus) look blurry. Maybe it's time to try the steps laid out in Photo.Net's [Focus Testing](http://photo.net/learn/focustest/) article. Or even try [AutoFocuX](http://www.precisioncaps.com/autofocux.html)???
