[Digital Photography School](http://digital-photography-school.com/8-guidelines-to-taking-panoramic-photos-with-any-camera) recently published [8 Guidelines To Taking Panoramic Photos With Any Camera](http://digital-photography-school.com/8-guidelines-to-taking-panoramic-photos-with-any-camera). I'm trying to learn more about panoramas, including using software (such as Photoshop, [Autostitch](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mbrown/autostitch/autostitch.html), [AutoPano](http://www.autopano.net/en/), and even [Pano for the iPhone](http://debaclesoftware.com/)) to generate panoramas. These 8 tips are helpful, and should make any panoramic photographs more attractive.
