Edgar Martins replies to the whole controversy stirred up by his photographs in the NYT Magazine. [Read his own words](http://www.edgarmartins.com/html/09_07_19_how_i_can_see.html), where he quotes Nietzsche, Roland Barthes, and Susan Sontag.

None of his post sounds even vaguely like an apology in the modern sense of the word, but an apology in the classical sense -- a proof of his beliefs. I should have known I was in trouble when he starts with a quotation from Nietzsche.
