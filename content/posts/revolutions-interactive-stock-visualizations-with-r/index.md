[Jeroen Ooms](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~jeroen/), a visiting scholar at UCLA's Department of Statistics, has been very busy with R -- he has two wonderfully slick online apps where users are able (for free) to visualize datasets using R's ggplot. If you're interested in R, stocks, or just data visualization, you'll find something of real value in his applications.

The older of the two apps, his [Stockplot](http://vps.jeroenooms.com/stockplot), lets you view stock performance over time, using R and [ggplot2](http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/) to display historical details of these stocks.The app uses drag-and-drop, line smoothing, adjustable time windows, etc. He originally posted about the app on his blog on August 13th, 2009.

On December 15th, 2009, he posted about his latest app: what he calls the "[ggplot2 webapp](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~jeroen/ggplot2.html)" where you can upload arbitrary datasets and specify how they should be digested and displayed using a "(big) subset of plots" that ggplot2 supports.

Both apps are very impressive displays of the power of R + ggplot2. Mr. Ooms has done a fantastic job bringing R/ggplot2 to the web. Thanks!

P.S. Thanks to [Revolutions](http://blog.revolution-computing.com/) for [their coverage of Stockplot](http://blog.revolution-computing.com/2009/09/interactive-stock-visualizations.html) and [the ggplot2 webapp](http://blog.revolution-computing.com/2009/12/a-webbased-graphics-application-based-on-r.html).
