Found this nice Java app that takes the whole concept of semantic web to an implementable level: [MindRaider - Semantic Web Outliner](http://www.mindcognition.com/). I've been using [InfoHesive](http://www.2brightsparks.com/infohesive/index.html) by [2brightsparks](http://www.2brightsparks.com/) but would welcome a cross-browser tool. [Java Outline Editor](http://outliner.sourceforge.net/), [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) and [3D TopicScape](http://www.topicscape.com/) (which just released a new version, BTW) are other tools I like, but neither has all the features in one package. MindRaider looks like it just might... Off to the tests...
