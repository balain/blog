[Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman), at Columbia University, clearly enjoys his work. Anyone who publishes this must: "My quick take on the Souter replacement is that ... Obama could nominate Pee Wee Herman to the Supreme Court and get him confirmed. But I'm no expert on this..." Very funny. I wonder what he's like in person.

He posted a thorough and enlightening review of the possibilities for the next Supreme Court justice, based on current (and recently departed) judges: [http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2009/05/the\_next\_suprem.html.](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2009/05/the_next_suprem.html) Take some time to scour through his write-up.Â  While you're at it, treat yourself to the rest of his blog. It's rich!
