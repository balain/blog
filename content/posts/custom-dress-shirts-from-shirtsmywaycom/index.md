Unfortunately, I haven't yet seen any shirts from [ShirtsMyWay.com](http://www.shirtsmyway.com/), but the flexibility and myriad options (7 trillion, they say) is truly impressive. They're running a 3-for-2 special through 4/22, so I think I might give them a go. Most of their shirts are in the $65-$75 range.

Brooks Brothers charges much more for a similar service, so I'm excited by the possibility that this site provides similar features at a much smaller price tag. More info to follow...[](http://www.shirtsmyway.com/)
