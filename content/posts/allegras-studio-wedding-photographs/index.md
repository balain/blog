I'm trying to learn how to take good wedding photographs, since an engaged couple (friends of mine) asked me to take the pictures for their upcoming wedding. In looking around the web, I've found a few photographers who take nice, clean, but emotive pictures. [Allegra's Studio](http://www.allegrasstudio.com/newsite/) has a beautiful gallery of wedding photographs, where the subjects are glowing, the pictures are crisp, but the picture invites you in.

It's a lot of fun looking around at how others take pictures. Who knows. I might just make this a new hobby :)
