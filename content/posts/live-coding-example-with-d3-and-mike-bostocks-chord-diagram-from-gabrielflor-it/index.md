> Bret Victor is a genius. His recent CUSEC 2012 talk, Inventing on Principle, is one of the best talks I've ever seen. If you watch only one talk this year, make sure it's this one.

> I was blown away by his 'live coding' idea, but couldn't find any actual live examples, so I put together a quick demo using d3 and Ace. I 100% totally based it on Bret's idea - down to the clever book styling. Imitation is the sincerest... etc etc.

> The default code is Mike Bostock's beautiful chord diagram, tweaked to fit the Twilight theme. And remember, click the pulsing red numbers and hold down the alt key!
