Another fascinating piece from FlowingData: "Progress: A Graphical Report on the State of the World" \[[http://projects.flowingdata.com/state-of-the-world/index.html](http://projects.flowingdata.com/state-of-the-world/index.html)\] shows, visually, massive amounts of data from the UN, all of which is freely available. Check out the rest of the FlowingData website ([http://www.flowingdata.com/](http://www.flowingdata.com/)) for more treats!
