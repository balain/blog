[![Mike Wirth's History of the American Flag Infographic](images/wirthusflag2009site.jpg)](http://www.mikewirthart.com/wp-content/gallery/visualized-information/wirthusflag2009site.jpg)  

[Mike Wirth](http://www.mikewirthart.com/infographics/) has posted [a beautiful infographic on the history of the American Flag](http://www.mikewirthart.com/wp-content/gallery/visualized-information/wirthusflag2009site.jpg) -- how it became what it is today, complete with colonies for the red and white stripes and states for each of the stars. Fantastic, and just in time for July 4th!
