So, [Data.gov](http://www.data.gov) is finally open and serving up links to data. I haven't had a chance to dig in, yet, but since 3 of my favorite blogs ([FlowingData](http://flowingdata.com/2009/05/21/datagov-is-live-get-your-data-while-its-hot/), [ProgrammableWeb](http://blog.programmableweb.com/2009/05/22/us-government-launches-datagov/), and [DataVisualization](http://www.datavisualization.ch/datasets/us-government-data-on-datagov)) covered it, I thought I should at least mention it here.

P.S. Although not explicitly tied to data.gov, keep in mind the upcoming [OECD](http://www.oecd.org/) [Seminar on Innovative Approaches to Turn Statistics into Knowledge](http://www.oecd.org/document/33/0,3343,en_40033426_40033828_42054241_1_1_1_1,00.html "Seminar on Innovative Approaches to Turn Statistics into Knowledge") in DC July 15th and 16th. [Amanda Cox from NYT](http://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch?query=amanda+cox&srchst=cse) is scheduled to attend. See [accolades from Tufte himself](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00035a&topic_id=1). Woohoo.
