The NYT posted a fine graphic -- [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/12/15/us/politics/DEBATE.html](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/12/15/us/politics/DEBATE.html) -- showing references between candidates, using a slick and informative network diagram. Shows how useful a bird's eye view can be, but still allow diving into the details.

But are all the debate transcripts represented?
