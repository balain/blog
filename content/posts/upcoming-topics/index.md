Over the next few weeks, I'll be posting a few new articles, which are currently percolating...

- How Teaching public schools and managing in a corporation are so similar;
- [Why](https://blog.balinsbooks.com/2008/11/17/two-great-encryption-tools/) [TrueCrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/ "TrueCrypt") [and](https://blog.balinsbooks.com/2008/11/17/two-great-encryption-tools/) [KeePass](http://keepass.info "KeePass") [are two awesome tools](https://blog.balinsbooks.com/2008/11/17/two-great-encryption-tools/);
- How good furniture design (like [Thomas Moser](http://www.thomasmoser.com "Thomas Moser")) and good data visualization (c.f. [JunkCharts](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/ "JunkCharts") and [Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com "Edward Tufte")) are similar (and different)

Suggestions? Ideas? Let me know!
