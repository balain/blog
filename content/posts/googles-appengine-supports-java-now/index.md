Google just rolled out [Java support for their AppEngine](http://code.google.com/appengine/), which previously only supported Python. This is great news since it opens the whole AppEngine to Java programmers (or at least those of us who know Java better than Python;). They say it's an early release, but it's a step in the right direction!

I've downloaded the Eclipse plugin, installed it, and generated both an GWT and plain JSP for my site. Creation was easy, uploading was a snap, and running it worked well. There are only two complaints/notes:

1\. Installation of the Eclipse plugin froze the Eclipse app twice. I killed the Eclipse process and re-tried the installation. It worked the third time. No problems since.

2\. Versioning is weak. I tried to upload a new app and label it version 1.1, but the upload failed. It only worked when I provided an integer value. Seems silly that versions have to be integers. Oh well...

Otherwise, works great. I look forward to learning the new features.
