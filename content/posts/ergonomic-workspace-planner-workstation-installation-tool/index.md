Off and on, I've been curious how my workspace stacks up in the ergonomics area. When I found a pointer to the [Ergonomic Workspace Planner, Workstation Installation Tool](http://www.ergotron.com/tabid/305/language/en-US/default.aspx), the time to check it out in earnest had come. Turns out my dimensions are very close to the recommended distances. Phew. Glad it worked out.
