The [WSJ](http://www.wsj.com/) posted [an interesting timeline graphic](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704289504575313120800627684.html?mod=WSJ_worldCup_Left_TopStories) showing the flow of ball control during the recent Mexico/France World Cup match:

Is the area under the graph the time of possession? What does the distance from the center axis mean?

Maybe the marginal shots/goals/cards line could be incorporated into the main graph more effectively -- especially if the distance from the center axis is time, those three measures could be plotted from the center axis.

Just an idea...
