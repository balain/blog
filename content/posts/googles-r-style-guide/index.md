I'm still pretty new to R, but find that Google's using it in lots of places, like [MapReduce](http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html). [Google's R Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/google-r-style.html) outlines the directions to [R](http://www.r-project.org/) programmers. It's an interesting read -- very simple and efficient. (Thanks to [the post on Revolutions blog](http://blog.revolution-computing.com/2009/08/googles-coding-standards-for-r.html) for the link.)
