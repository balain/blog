I still don't quite understand it, but, according to [John Cisne](http://www.geo.cornell.edu/eas/res_surf_sed/faculty/john_cisne.html), a paleontologist who studied the Book of Kells, the medieval scribes who illustrated this amazing manuscript employed "free-fusion stereocomparison" to generate the intricate scrollwork that can be found throughout the pages. With detail to the point of "submillimeter precision", Cisne, in the journal _[Perception](http://www.perceptionweb.com/)_ (Vol. 38, No. 7), argues that the medieval monks uses this method to create the wonderful artwork in the Book of Kells and other beautiful manuscripts.
