From [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/19/jrr-tolkien-beowulf-translation-published) today: "Hwæt! Almost 90 years after JRR Tolkien translated the 11th-century poem Beowulf, The Lord of the Rings author's version of the epic story is to be published for the first time in an edition which his son Christopher Tolkien says sees his father 'enter\[ing\] into the imagined past' of the heroes."
