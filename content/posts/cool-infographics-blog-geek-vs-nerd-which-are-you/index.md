[Cool Infographics - Blog - Geek vs. Nerd: Which Are You?](http://www.coolinfographics.com/blog/2012/1/20/geek-vs-nerd-which-are-you.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CoolInfographics+%28Cool+Infographics%29&utm_content=Google+Reader) is a clever infographic to help us distinguish between geeks and nerds. A little too much detail, but entertaining nevertheless.

Another fun digression is the Geek Test \[[http://www.innergeek.us/geek.html](http://www.innergeek.us/geek.html)\] where you can see just how geeky you really are. I just scored 30.81181% -- Total Geek. So there!
