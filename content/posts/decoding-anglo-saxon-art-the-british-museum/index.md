Rosie Weetch, curator, and Craig Williams, illustrator, British Museum provide a brief guide for understanding the transition of Anglo-Saxon art between the 5th and 11th centuries in [a recent blog post on The British Museum's website](http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/05/28/decoding-anglo-saxon-art/). Based on three significant examples (a 6th century Isle of Wight brooch, a Sutton Hoo gold buckle, and the Fuller Brooch), they show how styles shifted from the birds' heads and often obscure figures to the Trewhiddle Style in the 9th century with the Fuller Brooch. A fascinating and brief view into some beautiful works of art.
