Don't know whether to take this seriously or not... Photojojo is selling a bottle-cap tripod \[[http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/bottle-cap-tripod](http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/bottle-cap-tripod)\]. For $10, even if it were a joke, it's pretty harmless. And if they're serious, it's a good deal. :)
