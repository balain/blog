While I'm no statistician, I've enjoyed dabbling in R and appreciate its simplicity and power. Take the LOESS function, for example. It's built in to R. [Excel needs a plug-in](http://peltiertech.com/WordPress/loess-utility-for-excel/). Wow. Gotta love R. Used to love Excel, then I grew up (just a little :)
