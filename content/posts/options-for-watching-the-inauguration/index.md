LifeHacker has a nice write-up listing some ways to watch the inauguration tomorrow: [http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/lifehacker/full/~3/ZzH3mAEEhsQ/lifehackers-guide-to-catching-the-inauguration-from-anywhere](http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/lifehacker/full/~3/ZzH3mAEEhsQ/lifehackers-guide-to-catching-the-inauguration-from-anywhere)

From that article: "**The Official Sites:** Just in case you don't have it bookmarked, add the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies' [official site](http://inaugural.senate.gov/index.cfm) to your list of viewing venues. The JCCIC will have live video streams (with closed captioning), and the site itself has a wealth of information on everything inaugural, including clips of previous presidents' ceremonies and tons of minutiae (including recipes for inaugural luncheons, like Obama's "brace of American birds." The [Presidential Inaugural Committee](http://www.pic2009.org/content/home/) will also have streaming coverage, but it has to be noted that viewing the stream requires installing Microsoft's Silverlight 2 platform (and which, thereby, leaves Linux and mobile users out in the cold). If you're cool with that, though, ReadWriteWeb has a great [blow-by-blow schedule](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/your_complete_guide_to_celebra.php) of the PIC's offerings."
