[![balinjdl running history (slowgeek.com)](http://images.pageglimpse.com/v1/thumbnails?url=http://slowgeek.com/pr/balinjdl&size=large&devkey=49ffb7fa3778d967404d5364d1ad86e7)](http://slowgeek.com/pr/balinjdl)

I recently found [a post on the Nike+ forums](http://forums.nike.com/thread.jspa?messageID=137569&#137569) that describes how to get the running history (in detail). It also shows how to access the data via [slowgeek.com](http://slowgeek.com/), a very slick adventure indeed!

P.S. I was going to set up a running blog, but don't know if I will now. Slowgeek.com gives me the data I was looking for, though I'm still itching to learn and use [OpenFlashCharts](http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart/)!
