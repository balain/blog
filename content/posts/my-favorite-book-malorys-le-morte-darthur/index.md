Sir Thomas Malory is, in my opinion, one of the greatest writers in the English language. He had a flair for elegant prose, covering topics rich in imagery and zest. I had the great fortune of meeting P.J.C. Field, the editor of the Oxford (Eugene Vinaver) Le Morte D'Arthur several years ago on a trip through the U.K.

I just found a new widget that shows images from the Malory text and thought I'd post it here. I hope you enjoy the text as much as I do, but you should really treat yourself to the P.J.C. Field edition (only $245 [on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Works-Sir-Thomas-Malory-English/dp/0198123442/ref=sr_1_19?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235870482&sr=1-19)).
