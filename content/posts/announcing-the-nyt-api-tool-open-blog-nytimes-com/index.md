The New York Times just announced [the NYT API Tool](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/announcing-the-nyt-api-tool/) on their website. Geared toward making use of their API easier, the web interface shows the options, allows for setting custom parameters, and facilitates pulling data from their site as easy as possible. For real use, [you'll need a key](http://developer.nytimes.com/apps/register), but once you have it, you can pull data from their site programmatically. It won't be as easy as their API Tool, but at least you can make more calls with fewer keystrokes.

Interested in their API, but don't know how to program? Know how to program, but don't know if it'll be worth the effort? Either way, [give their API tool a shot](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/announcing-the-nyt-api-tool/).
