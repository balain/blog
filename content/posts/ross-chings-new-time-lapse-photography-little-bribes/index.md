\[[Death Cab for Cutie - Little Bribes](http://vimeo.com/4729762) from [Ross Ching](http://vimeo.com/rossching) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).\]

Very impressive time-lapse of [Death Cab for Cutie](http://www.deathcabforcutie.com)'s Little Bribes by [Ross Ching](http://rossching.com/) -- [http://rossching.com/little-bribes/](http://rossching.com/little-bribes/). Shot almost completely in LA, he describes how he put together his video (and states that he isn't affiliated with the band) on his website. Treat yourself to a few minutes of impressive creativity. Wow.

P.S. This has to be the dumbest name for a band (but what do I know?? My favorite band's name is [The Police](http://www.thepolice.com)! :), but the song is fun...
