Through [an article on Smashing Magazine's website](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/10/35-beautiful-photography-websites/), I found a link to [Jason Bell's website: http://www.jasonbellphoto.com/](http://www.jasonbellphoto.com/). I'm still a real beginner with photography and recognizing photographers' names, but I really enjoy Jason's work. Check out his website to see portraits and landscapes, all well done and very attractive. Although I'm not myself keen on portrait work, his is what I would like to emulate.
