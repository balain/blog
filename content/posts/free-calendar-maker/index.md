I don't know about you, but I frequently find myself creating a calendar in Excel, spending more time than I should trying to get it to look nice. I found a new site, [CalendarLabs.com](http://www.calendarlabs.com/), that lets you print or download calendars in Office, PDF or iCal format. Sounds like it might be worth a look...
