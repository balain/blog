If you're interested in seeing the code for the OT/NT Ref graph, I've posted it to GitHub: [balinjdl/OT-NT-Reference-Map - GitHub](https://github.com/balinjdl/OT-NT-Reference-Map). All source files are there, along with a README, LICENSE, and sample graphics. I'll continue posting about the development here, but code changes will only be updated on GitHub. Enjoy!
